#Overview
Application that allows users to record short textual entries about a meal in real time while they
listen to a curated soundscape. These entries are saved to a database, and available to be
displayed and updated in real time. An admin panel allows control over the entries (delete,
edit), enable DTLJ to add new restaurants with associated URLs and content, search & filter
entries and survey the app stats.
